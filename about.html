        <h1>Who am I?</h1>
        <h5>I am currently a senior at Michigan State University pursuing a degree in information science. I am interested in all things tech, and am looking to work in the technology field post graduation</h5>
        <h1>College and Workplace Experience</h1>
        <h5>This past summer I interned at Sarsfield Technology in Troy, Michigan. I took on the role of a networking technician intern and worked with my colleagues to help our clients solve all of their technological problems, such as repairing downed networks and firewalls, imaging new computers, and even installing the proper network cables for new businesses. Some of the relavent courses that I have taken at MSU include applied programming in python, web design and development, fundamentals of cybersecurity, and user experience.</h5>
        <h1>Interests and Hobbies</h1>
        <h5>Outside of the classroom and workplace, my biggest passion is golf. It is my favorite thing to do, as I really love the mental and physical challenges it brings upon you. Some of my other hobbies include lifting weights/personal fitness and hiking</h5>
